### info

`src` : contains all source files.

`data` : contains all data files.

The reason for doing this -> in the code we can use `cross-platform` file paths in case different platforms are being used (such as `Windows`, `linux(including WSL)`, `Mac`)

### src

`Preprocessing.py` : reponsible for finding files and loading data, ideally some pre-processing operations are also performed. [under construction]
